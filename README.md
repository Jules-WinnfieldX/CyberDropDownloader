# Information

**Requires Python 3.7 or higher (3.10 recommended)**

You can get Python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure you tick the check box for "Add python to path"
![alt text](https://simp2.jpg.church/PATHe426c23371048def.png)

`cyberdrop-dl` will take the title of the archive and create a new folder for it, and download all of the available media to that folder.
It'll repeat that for every link you give it.

# Installation

## Manually
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Jules-WinnfieldX/CyberDropDownloader/releases) and download the Cyberdrop_DL.zip file. Extract it to wherever you want the program to be.
## Using `pip`
Once Python is installed, run `pip3 install cyberdrop-dl`.

Advanced users may want to use virtual environments (via `pipx`), but it's **NOT** required.

# Usage

## Manual way (Manual install above)
Put the links in the URLs.txt file then run `Start Windows.bat` (Windows) or `Start Mac.command` (OS X) or `Start Linux.sh` (Linux).

** Mac users will need to run the command `chmod +x 'Start Mac.command'` to make the file executable.

## Simple (Pip install above)
1. Run `cyberdrop-dl` once to generate an empty `URLs.txt` file.
2. Copy and paste your links into `URLs.txt`.
Each link you add has to go on its own line (paste link, press enter, repeat).
3. Run `cyberdrop-dl` again.
It will begin to download everything.
4. Enjoy!

## Custom way (Pip install above)
If you know what you're doing, you can use some of the available options to adjust how the program runs.
```
$ cyberdrop-dl -h
